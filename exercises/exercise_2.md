# Exercise 2 - TBD

In this exercise, you get to familiarize yourself with SQL. For the practical exercises, you can open up your local repository as a project and make new connections to each databse file that you will work with.

> [!NOTE]
> To ingest data to the database, you should use CLI in combination with SQL script, as the relative path from dbeaver is not from the repository. Also absolute path is not recommended as this won't work for another computer.

> [!NOTE]
> Try not to skip those tasks which are more free, where you need to think what else that could be explored, transformed etc. These are very important as in industry it's common that you need to explore data and participate in stakeholders and team discussions.

## 0. Dice rolls simulations

&nbsp; a) Generate 10 rows of dice rolls data

&nbsp; b) Calculate the average of getting a six

&nbsp; c) Generate 100 rows of dice rolls and calculate average of getting a six

&nbsp; d) Repeat the experiment with 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000 rolls. Can you make these in the same query, so you get one column for each experiment?  
The result set could look similar to this

| 10 rolls | 100 | 1000 | 10000 | 100000 | 1000000 |
| -------- | --- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| 0.5      | 0.2 | ...  | ...   | ...    | ...     |



## 2. Theory questions
