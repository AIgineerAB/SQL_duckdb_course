# Exercise 0 - Introduction

In this exercise, you get to familiarize yourself with SQL. For the practical exercises, you can open up your local repository as a project and make new connections to each databse file that you will work with. 

> [!NOTE]
> To ingest data to the database, you should use CLI in combination with SQL script, as the relative path from dbeaver is not from the repository. Also absolute path is not recommended as this won't work for another computer. 

## 1. Exploring hemnet data

Go to this [link to download hemnet data from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/florianlandras/stockholm-house-market-prices). Place the csv file into your local repository.

&nbsp; a) Create a database file called `hemnet.duckdb` and ingest the data from the csv file into your database. 

&nbsp; b) Make a wildcard selection to checkout the data

&nbsp; c) Find out how many rows there are in the table

&nbsp; d) Describe the table that you have ingested to see the columns and data types. 

&nbsp; e) Find out the 5 most expensive homes sold.

&nbsp; f) Find out the 5 cheapest homes sold.

&nbsp; g) 

&nbsp; h) 



## 2. Theory questions

These study questions are good to get an overview of how SQL and relational databases work.

&nbsp; a) What is SQL, and why is it important in relational databases?

&nbsp; b) Explain the difference between HAVING and WHERE clauses.

&nbsp; c) Explain the purpose of the LIMIT or TOP clause in a SQL query.

&nbsp; d) What are the primary functions of the Data Definition Language (DDL) in SQL?

&nbsp; e) Explain the differences between the Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Definition Language (DDL).

&nbsp; f) What type of dot commands are there in duckdb?

&nbsp; g) Is DuckDB optimized for OLAP or OLTP workloads?

&nbsp; h) What makes DuckDB unique compared to other databases?

&nbsp; i) Is DuckDB suitable for real-time data processing?

&nbsp; j) Difference between read_csv and read_csv_auto

&nbsp; k) What is the purpose and advantages of using an IDE such as DBeaver?
