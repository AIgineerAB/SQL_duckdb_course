## SQL exercises online 

Most of these exercises online could be done directly in the browser. However I recommend creating own SQL scripts and ingesting the data so that you can version control your code.

## ChatGPT to generate questions

In case you want to have inspirations on questions on a specific dataset you could input a dataset directly into ChatGPT and prompt it to give a set of questions to you. An example of a prompt could be in the style 

> Act as an SQL teacher in DuckDB and give me 10 basic questions about this dataset. Don't give me the answers however, write out a short hint to me. I would like to have questions for exploratory data analysis of this dataset. Categorize my questions into simple, intermediate and advanced.  

> [!NOTE]
> Some prompt engineering techniques that I used for this prompt are 
> - context about dataset or send in dataset directly 
> - persona (act as)
> - varying difficulty and categorize them accordingly 
> - purpose of the questions (exploratory data analysis)
